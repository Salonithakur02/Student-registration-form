# Student Registration Form – Advanced Web Design

##  Project Overview  
This project is developed as part of the *Advanced Web Design* course and focuses on creating a fully functional **Student Registration System** using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The system allows users to register students, view their data, edit details, and delete records. It demonstrates the core concepts of **form handling**, **CRUD operations**, and **responsive web design**.

##  Objective  
The objective of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly, responsive, and efficient registration form that collects student details and manages them through backend CRUD operations using PHP and MySQL.

##  Dataset Source  
This project does not use an external dataset.  
All data is **manually entered** by the user through the registration form, then stored in a MySQL database.
